                    <h3 id="firstSectionSubheading">Run-on sentences are sentences that include too many words, splice different sections of a sentence together that should be seperated, and introduce seperate ideas within a single sentence.  Most of the time, run-on sentences should be fairly obvious when reading text aloud or reading carefully.</h3>

                    <h2 id="secondSectionHeading">How do you fix a run-on sentence?</h2>
                    <h3 id="secondSectionSubheading">Most run-on sentences can be fixed by simply adding punctuation. 
                    In most cases, if you don't want to create seperate sentences, you can simply add commas to increase sentence fluency.  Sometimes, however, you might simply want to seperate it into seperate sentences for readability.</h3>

                    <h2 id="thirdSectionHeading">Examples: </h2>
                    <ul id="thirdSectionSubheading">
                        <li class="bulletPoint">Readability: "I like to go to the store and I like to buy pineapples and I like to buy oranges and I like to buy peaches"  becomes  "I like to go to the store. 
                When I'm at the store, I like to buy oranges, pineapples, and peaches."</li>
                        <li class="bulletPoint">Efficiency: Long sentences can be shortened to keep text concise.  For example, "I really like this store, I think this store is really cool and I think it's flashy and I think it's neat and I think it's cheap" could become "I really like this store and I think it's really cool, flashy, neat, and cheap."</li>
                        <li class="bulletPoint">Meaning: Sometimes, longer sentences without proper punctuation change the meaning of the text and makes the purpose unclear.  Ensure that different sentences are seperated to keep their individual meaning.</li>
