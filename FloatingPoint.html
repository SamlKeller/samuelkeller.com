                <h1 id="Title">The release of FloatingPoint</h1>
                <p id="p1" class="Text">FloatingPoint released in early beta recently and is now playable at <a href="https://playfloatingpoint.com/home.html" target="_blank">playfloatingpoint.com</a>.  This article will explain the current state of the game, what will occur with future updates, and how the game will change over time.</p>
                <p id="p2" class="Text">FloatingPoint has been in development for almost two years and has now been released as an open beta hosted exclusively on playfloatingpoint.com.  At the moment, FloatingPoint only works on Linux and Windows desktops as well as MacOS providing the user follows a few extra steps, however eventually FloatingPoint will expand to various other platforms including WebGL, Xbox X, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Steam, lower end devices, and others to be announced.  Adding these platforms will make FloatingPoint a game playable almost anywhere one might wish.  Furthermore, FloatingPoint is completely free to download and play and will remain so.</p>
                <p id="yesItsMe" class="Text">Currently, FloatingPoint has released with AI in substitution for a full, networked approach in favor of an earlier release.  While account systems that will be present in future releases are present, they will be significantly expanded upon to include friend systems, parties, voice chat, and matchmaking with other players to allow for greater interactivity.  It is expected that many of these features will be released as the game moves into a full version.  While FloatingPoint progresses to this point, various other features will be integrated to create a better experience for the player such as:</p>
                <ul class="List">
                    <li>Improved performance</li>
                    <li>User settings</li>
                    <li>Expanded leaderboards</li>
                    <li>Other game modes and weapons</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="Inspiration" class="Text">Additionally, these releases will eventually include walling previous versions of the game after it has been updated.  For now, access to all versions of the game is allowed but not recommended.  Additionally, these versions of the game will eventually lose access to leaderboards and networked functionality.</p>
                <p id="notReallyMe" class="Text">Most current features will be present in future full releases.  Upon said releases of the game, play against AI will be moved to a separate mode and a networked approach will take precedent.  Players will machmake either individually or in parties, and will play against other, real players in real time.  The other changes listed above will also apply.</p>
                <p id="aboutCost" class="Text">Finally, FloatingPoint will continue to update on a regular basis.  Updates can be expected on a semi-weekly basis for smaller patches and on a monthly basis for larger ones.</p>
                <p id="Development" class="Text">FloatingPoint will move out of beta within a year.</p>
